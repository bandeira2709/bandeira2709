$\Huge Hey!$ $\textcolor{green}{\textsf{â™£}}$

I am a Computer Science graduate with experience working on internationally distributed teams. I have not yet contributed to multiple open projects and am still learning my way through the community.

â˜• I developed and improved many Jira plugins while working for Motorola, so I have a lot of experience on **Jira administration** and **Java development** using APIs. On SAP I worked on projects using SAP UI5 and CAP / CDS. 

ðŸŽ® Did some lecturing on **game development** for kids and teenagers back in 2017 during graduation so you're welcome to hit me up on game development ideas and concepts. Used Unity, Roblox, Construct, Scratch and more. I am now experimenting on Unreal alongside a friend.

ðŸ”— More of a professional resume can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/knandobs) profile. There may be a longer list of relevant programming languages and knowledge there too.

Feel free to contact me.
