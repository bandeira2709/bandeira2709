$\Huge Hey!$ $\textcolor{green}{\textsf{â™£}}$

I am a Computer Science graduate with experience working on an internationally distributed team. I have not yet contributed to multiple open projects and am still learning my way through the community.

â˜• I developed and improved many Jira plugins while working for an undisclosed company (NDA signed ðŸ˜Ÿ), so I have a lot of experience on **Jira administration** and **Java development** using APIs.

ðŸŽ® Did some lecturing on **game development** for kids and teenagers back in 2017 during graduation so you're welcome to hit me up on game development ideas and concepts. Used Unity, Roblox, Construct, Scratch and more.

ðŸ”— More of a personal resume can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/knandobs) profile. There is a longer list of relevant programming languages there too.

Feel free to contact me.
